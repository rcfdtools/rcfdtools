### Freeboard (Fb)

Freeboard in water channels is the vertical distance between the normal water surface and the top of the channel bank, acting as a crucial safety margin to prevent overtopping from surges, waves, or unexpected flow increases, ensuring water stays within the channel and doesn't flood surrounding areas or cause structural damage, often a percentage of channel depth or a fixed height, varying by application like irrigation or flood control. It's a design element to manage uncertainties, from wind action to operational errors, keeping hydraulic structures like flumes and weirs functioning correctly.
