Hi and welcome to @rcfdtools, check all my projects here in https://github.com/rcfdtools. I’m interested in Geographical Information Systems - GIS, Hydrology, Hydraulics, Civil Engineering and urban developing projects. I'm currently learning and improving computational numeric methods and CFD in my GitHub projects and i'm looking to collaborate on engineering research projects.
